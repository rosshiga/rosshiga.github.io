JavaScript in my eyes is has a huge potential for the future of most traditional applications. JavaScript has blossomed since my days of using AJAX and simple built-in functions. I believe it has achieved what Java originally set out to be, a write once and run anywhere portable runtime. JavaScript now runs in our pockets, in desktop applications, and even the server side. Node.js is comparatively lightweight to the JVM but nonetheless has revolutionized not just large monolithic application but front-end UI design and paradigm. npm has brought the packaging system into the language space and out of the apt and yum world. I’m most excited for the future Electron desktop apps which bundle native OS interfaces.

I find it troubling though while easier to use and code, for me than PHP or Python, that I perceive a high barrier to getting into the cooler stuff beyond ECMAScript. I have had much difficulty in the past working with React, Ionic, and angular.js. There are many terms and dependencies that aren’t familiar to me like Webpack, JSX, and Babel mixed in with things less foreign like SASS, HTML, and CSS. The dizzying array of options is a natural side effect of npm and open package repositories. Virtualenv and pip do provide those dizzy options as well but when I try to dive into JavaScript, there seem to be more traps and cross-dependency issues. The language matures at incredible rates and I feel like you need to learn and re-learn constantly with no clear life cycle.

Aside from my personal frustration with learning the newest and arguably best things of JavaScript like node.js, I find the language to be greatly powerful. Functional programming with objects and prototypes is something that seems to come naturally with the language. The fact that most devices sold in the last decade have some form of JavaScript interpreter seems to have poised it to be a major language beyond the traditional script tag. 

I want to bring the web app, write once and deploy, philosophy to what I see as in increasingly fragmented platform space. Play Store and App Store don’t need to exist when we can deploy a single code base with native CSS views for screen sizes and native API translation with JavaScript. None of this Electron here, Kotlin there, Swift everywhere mantra where we have to give app stores a cut because they set the rules on payment integrations. Open, native, but JavaScript and HTML applications for all users on all platforms under a unified repo. Let’s hope [W3 Service and Web Workers]( https://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers-1/) with JavaScript come to pass and push us to a more open and platform diverse computing world.
